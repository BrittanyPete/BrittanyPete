# Full Stack Web Developer

### Hey! :wave: I'm Brittany!

ðŸ’» Currently, I am finishing up my course at Bloom Institute of Technology!

ðŸ“ˆ I'm a life-long learner, always looking to improve. I'm currently learning data structures and algorithms.

ðŸŽŽ I love styling a website, and figuring out how I can make the UI/UX a positive experience. I'd love to collaborate on projects looking for help in this area.

âš¡ Fun fact: Birds terrify me, but my favorite animal is an owl.
