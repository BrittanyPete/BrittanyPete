# Full Stack Web Developer

### Hey! :wave: I'm Brittany!

💻 Currently, I am finishing up my course at Bloom Institute of Technology!

🎎 I love styling a website, and figuring out how I can make the UI/UX a positive experience. I'd love to collaborate on projects looking for help in this area.

⚡ Fun fact: Birds terrify me, but my favorite animal is an owl.
